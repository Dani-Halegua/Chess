As a data and chess lover, I did some small projects around chess. You will find them here :

-FIDE chess players.ipynb is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset that contains data about all FIDE chess players as of january 2024. 


-pred_resultat_lichess.ipynb is a small machine learning project. The goal of this project is to predict the result of a given chess position played by 2 humans based on the computer evaluation of the position.
The model is based on a logistic regression and is trained on a dataset that contains games played on the website lichess.org and their computer evaluations.

-Analyse_chpt_monde_echecs.ipynb : In this notebook, I analyzed all world chess championship matches in order to understand the evolution of the quality of play over time.
